This tool transforms vocabulary exported from Onyx boox leaf 3 for importing to anki.

* Prerequisite
- [X] Onyx boox leaf 3
- [X] Anki with the ~Dict2Anki-v6.16(Fixed for Anki23 by Shige)~ plugin. I use this plugin to import vocabulary from Eudic

* Steps
1. Export vocabulary from Onyx boox leaf 3, the export is a plaintext file, removed the first 2 lines from that file.
2. Run `boox2anki.py` to transform the plaintext file to ~anki_import.txt~.
3. Import ~anki_import.txt~ to Anki, choose these options:
    - In ~Field separator~, choose ~Tab~
    - In ~Existing notes~ select ~Preserve~
    - In ~Notetype~, select ~Dict2Anki-v6.16(Fixed for Anki23 by Shige)~. This prevents overwriting items imported for Eudic
    - In ~Field mapping~:
        - ~term~: choose 1
        - ~definition~: choose 3
        - ~AmEPhonetic~: chhose 2
4. Import
